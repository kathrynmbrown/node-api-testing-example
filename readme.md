node.js API Testing Example
==========================

This is an example of a testing stack for a node.js api. The stack I've put together here includes [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/), and [SuperTest](https://github.com/tj/supertest). Use these tests for reference when you are setting this stack up in your node project.
